# Pleiotropy_And_Resource_Allocation
This repository contains the code for a series of co-evolutionary simulations used to evaluate the interactions between pleiotropy, resource allocation, and sinaling network evolution.

All code is in julia, and necessary packages are included in the opening section of each script. Data used to generate figures used in the paper can be found in the supplemental materials of the paper.
Key
- anything that starts with "paper" is used to generate figures from the data generated by the other scripts
- TNOE: Two Networks One Effector, these are the shared effector simulations
- TNTE: Two Networks Two Effectors, these are the independent effector simulations
- VS: indicates a competitive simulation
- varCredit: indicates that the code had simulatoisn alternate between credit limits of 1 and .1
